I researched the documentations for images in java and tried setting up the constructor and some of the methods for the filters.

I'm currently still trying to get the constructor to work. I'm also trying to test out whether or not the array with rgb values can be edited easily. I also looked at the specific colors and found that the colors are expressed in hexadecimal.

I got my code to access the mage file as a buffered image properly and researched more about the BufferedImage methods and RGB color values. The values are not always in hexadecimal. They can be expressed as separate red, blue, and green values from 0 to 255 each. But I'm not sure how to get an array to return with the values as values of red, green, and blue.

I kept trying to fix the constructor but no matter what I try, nothing really works. So I decided to research a bit more.

I made a lot of progress in actually getting it to compile and run at least. I removed a lot of overcomplicated or unnescessary code. However, even though I got the code to run, it ended up returning null. I also added a pic to test out the code.

I got a pixel to return but it's a negative number.

01/16/19
I used an ArrayList instead of a regular array to have all the pixels in one place. This ended up working much much better because I did get an array with the pixels. However, the only problem is that the pixels end up returning in negative integers. I'm still not sure how to get them to return as separate red, green, and blue values.
